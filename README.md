Required Milestones:

1. Create a Library for Data Classification and Extraction

- the documents must be identified, classified, and divided
  into multiple groups
  submit a single file (image/pdf/word document)
  that contains many documents.
  To achieve:
  1. Class Extract
  2. Relevant Docstrings
  3. Implement functions in class - identify(take input and OCR function), save,
     OCR Function(conditions for diff documents and split based result)

2. Once document is classified and split, create a library which accepts split
   document and extracts the data from it.

Non-Tech Issues

1. Project README
2. Docstring for Functions
3. Find which all functions can be added to improve efficiency and workflow
